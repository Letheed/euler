*"Project Euler exists to encourage, challenge, and develop the skills and enjoyment of anyone with an interest in the fascinating world of mathematics."*


## Problems

Some problems provide a file containing data needed for solving it. Those input files are kept in [this shared directory](problems). Sometimes, files containing example or test data, usually smaller/easier datasets, will be available as well.


## Languages

Each language has its own dedicated directory. The sets of solved problems may vary between languages.

| Language              | Solved problems |
|-----------------------|-----------------|
| [Haskell](haskell)    | 1 to 120        |
| [Rust](rust)          | 1 to 52         |
